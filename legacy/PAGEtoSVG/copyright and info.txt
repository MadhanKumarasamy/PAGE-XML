must not be copied, distributed or used without permission from the author(s).

Under no circumstances will the author(s) be liable in any way for any

This version of the PAGEtoSVG converter/viewer has been developed for and
tested with Mozilla Firefox 3.6 only. Other browsers/viewers might work
but are not supported! 

Support for older as well as future versions of the PAGE format
is achieved by individual, namespace-depended xslt stylesheets. 

How to use:
1. Generate a jpg for the input tif image, keeping the same file name
	(apart from the extension)
2. Generate svg from input PAGE file using PAGEtoSVG.xsl and an XSLT processor
	of your choice, optional parameters:
	mode=[static|interactive] default: interactive
	embed=[true|false] default: true
	level=[all|border|printspace|regions|textlines|words|glyphs] default: all
	fbgimg=<path/filename> to an image, can be used to force a specific
					background image. If not set, the one given in the PAGE file
					is used.
	fcss=<path/filename> to a css file, can be used to force a specific
					css file. If not set, style.css will be used.
3. Open resulting svg file in Mozilla Firefox 3.6
